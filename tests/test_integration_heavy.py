Heavy Integration Tests - NOT FOR CI
===================================

These tests require:
- A loaded Neo4j database with 19M+ records
- Long execution times (5+ minutes each)
- Significant memory and CPU resources

Use for local testing only, not in CI/CD pipelines.
Run with: pytest tests/test_integration_heavy.py -v --tb=short
