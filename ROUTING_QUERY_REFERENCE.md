# Advanced Flight Routing Query Reference

## Overview

This document provides the production-ready flight routing query used in the Neo4j load testing framework. The query handles complex real-world scenarios including cross-day flights, realistic connection times, and proper time zone handling.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Cross-day flight handling**: Properly calculates duration for overnight flights (e.g., LAX‚ÜíJFK red-eye)
- ‚úÖ **Plain Cypher**: No APOC dependencies, fully compatible with Neo4j Aura
- ‚úÖ **Multi-route search**: Finds direct flights and 1-stop connections in a single query
- ‚úÖ **Realistic constraints**: Proper layover times (45min - 20hours), flight duration validation
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized**: Early filtering, indexed lookups, bounded results

```

## Parameters

- `$origin`: 3-letter airport code (e.g., "LAX")
- `$dest`: 3-letter airport code (e.g., "JFK")
- `$search_date`: Search date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2024-03-01")

## Data Issue Solved

This query specifically addresses a critical data interpretation issue where flights that cross midnight (overnight flights) had negative durations when calculated naively. For example:

- **Problem**: LAX‚ÜíJFK departing 23:35 and arriving 07:48 on the same date
- **Naive calculation**: 07:48 - 23:35 = -947 minutes ‚ùå
- **Correct calculation**: Cross-day flight duration = 493 minutes (8.2 hours) ‚úÖ

## Example Results

```
üõ´ LAX ‚Üí JFK: 5 routes (2 direct, 3 connections)
  ‚úàÔ∏è  Best: B61124 (8.2h) üåô
```

The üåô emoji indicates overnight flights that cross days.

## Extending to N-Stop Connections

This pattern can be extended to 2-stop, 3-stop connections by:

1. Adding additional `UNION ALL` clauses
2. Following the same cross-day calculation patterns
3. Maintaining realistic layover constraints
4. Using `LIMIT` clauses to prevent performance issues

## Performance Considerations

- Early filtering on indexed properties (`flightdate`, airport codes)
- Bounded results (`LIMIT 10`)
- Realistic constraints prevent combinatorial explosion
- Connection time validation happens after node matching

## Production Usage

This query is integrated into `neo4j_flight_load_test.py` as the `comprehensive_routing_search` task, providing realistic airline-style search patterns for load testing Neo4j flight databases.
