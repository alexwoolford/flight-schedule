NEO4J FLIGHT LOAD TEST - FLEXIBLE ROUTING
==========================================

Advanced load testing for Neo4j flight search with FLEXIBLE multi-hop routing.
Uses iterative deepening instead of hardcoded hop counts.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Dynamic path finding: finds routes of ANY length without hardcoding hops
‚Ä¢ Temporal sequencing: proper timing constraints throughout entire journey
‚Ä¢ Real flight search patterns: mimics airline booking platforms
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive cross-day flight handling (red-eye flights)
‚Ä¢ Performance optimized: bounded queries with early termination
